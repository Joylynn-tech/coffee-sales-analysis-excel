# coffee-sales-analysis-excel
Here I showcase my prowess when it comes to analyzing data with excel.
About this project
It is a data set containing sales from a coffee shop. The coffee shop has three locations. The Dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp and location, along with product-level details.
This data is from January to June 
My Process
I started off by removing duplicates. Then I checked my data to see if it has any missing values but I fond non.
I then made columns for other values from my data which include: Transaction time, Day of the week and Transaction month.
I proceeded to make pivot tables in order to perform my analysis.
I made pivots for: 
1.	The total sales by product category
2.	Average unit price of item
3.	Total revenue by month
4.	Transaction by week
Insight
We can also see that sales decrease substantially in the afternoon and in the case of the Lower Manhattan location there are almost no sales in the evening in order to save some money the store hours could possibly be shortened.
The 3 post popular product categories are coffee, tea, and bakery regardless of location.
